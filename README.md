# Folder Structure

- `index.js`- The main entry point of application. It is equivalent to React on the web mounting the project to the root DOM node
- `/android and /ios `- The folders where all the native code lives. If we needed to add or edit any platform specific native code, this is where we'd have to look. We also need to go into these folders if we have to install any native libraries
- `.prettierrc.js` - Code formatter which is again optional, but you can read more about it in our code style chapter
- `/src` - Base folder which will store all the necessary folders or files
  - `/components` - Where all the reusable components inside the project resides
  - `/config` - Contains all the configurations of the project
  - `/hooks` - Contains all the custom hooks inside the project
  - `/navigation` - Conatains all the navigations
  - `/redux` - Contains all the redux components such as store, saga and slice
  - `/screens` - Contains all the screens inside the project
  - `/utils` - Storing reusable methods

# Quick Start

## Create new React Native Project

To create new glim project, you can use

```bash
npx glim create-app [app-name]
```

Once's it running, it will create a new glim project with corresponding name along with typical folders and configuration files.

## Create new Component

```bash
npx glim generate --component [component-name]
```

## Create new Screen

```bash
npx glim generate --screen [screen-name]
```

## Create new Redux components
